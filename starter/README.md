# MyReads Project

The main page of the application shows three shelves with books. A user can move between shelves with the controls that are tied to each book instance. The search page contains a search input field. As the user types into the search field, books that match the query are displayed on the page, along with their titles and authors. Search results are not shown when all of the text is deleted out of the search input box. The user is able to search for multiple words, suc has "artificial intelligence". Serch results on the search page allow the user to select "Currently Reading", "Want to Read", or "Read" to placce the book in a certain shelf. When an item us categorized in the search page, it also appears in the main page.

This project was build wit the starter template (static example of the CSS and HTML markup without the React code) provided by Udacity.

## How to run

1. Download or clobe the repository.

2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

3. Run the app using `npm start`.

4. View the app at localhost:3000.

Remember that good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.

## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

- [`getAll`](#getall)
- [`update`](#update)
- [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll();
```

- Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
- This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf);
```

- book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
- shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]
- Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query);
```

- query: `<String>`
- Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
- These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/cra-template/template/README.md).
